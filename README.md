MATLAB functions to identify linear models from time series data.

Note that most of these capabilities are included in the MATLAB system identification module (e.g. using the [`idpoly`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/ident/ref/idpoly.html) function)

However, I developed these as part of a control engineering graduate course and provide them for educational purposes and perhaps for simple use cases where you may want to implement them from scratch.

## Example 1 - Identification of an ARX model

Suppose you have a time series of input and output measurements, u(k) and y(k), from an auto-regressive process. In this example the data is stored in the file `TP04_Q3.mat` in the 'data' folder:

```MATLAB
>> load('data/TP04_Q3.mat')
>> size(u), size(y)

ans =

    75     1


ans =

    75     1

>> [u(1:8,:) y(1:8,:)]

ans =

         0   -0.3269
         0   -0.8636
         0   -1.3269
         0   -1.4369
         0   -0.9990
    1.0000   -0.0325
    1.0000    0.8435
    1.0000    0.4339

```

And, suppose you know that the structure of the model is the following ARX model:

<img src='images/arx-model.png' width=245>

Then, you can estimate the model parameters, p = [a1; a2; b1; b2], as follows:

```MATLAB
>> na = 2; nb = 2; nk = 3;
>> p = idarx1([na nb nk],u,y)

p =

   -1.7866
    0.8102
   -0.3843
    0.4074

```

## Example 2 - Identification of an ARX model with constraints

Suppose, in the example above we are also able to determine that the static gain of the real system is -1.7.

This means that:

B(1) / A(1) = b1 + b2 / (1 + a1 + a2) = -1.7

or

1.7 a1 + 1.7 a2 + b1 + b2 = âˆ’1.7

We can impose this constraint using the two vectors F and G which represent the coefficients of the left and right-hand side of the equation:

F p = G

In this case, you can estimate the model parameters, p = [a1; a2; b1; b2], using the function [idarxct1](idarxct1.m) as follows:

```MATLAB
>> na = 2; nb = 2; nk = 3;
>> F = [1.7 1.7 1 1];
>> G = -1.7;
>> p = idarxct1([na nb nk],u,y,F,G)

p =

   -1.7888
    0.8088
   -0.3864
    0.3524

```
